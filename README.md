- Building secure, database-driven web applications
- Managing user authentication and sessions
- Structuring scalable Flask projects
- Implementing additional features like password reset, profile update, and admin dashboards

The portal stores user data in a local **SQLite database** and provides a personalized dashboard accessible only after authentication.
